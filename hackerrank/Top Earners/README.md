# [Top Earners](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/earnings-of-employees/problem)

We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly $salary\ Ã—\ months$ worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the <strong>Employee</strong> table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as $2$ space-separated integers.

<strong>Input Format</strong>

The <strong>Employee</strong> table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

The maximum earnings value is $66952$. The only employee with earnings $= 66952$ is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value ($66952$) and a count of the number of employees who have earned $`{\$66952}`$ (which is $1$) as two space-separated values.
