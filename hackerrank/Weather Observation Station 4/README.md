# [Weather Observation Station 4](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-4/problem)

Find the difference between the total number of <strong>CITY</strong> entries in the table and the number of distinct <strong>CITY</strong> entries in the table.

The <strong>STATION</strong> table is described as follows:

![Picture](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg)

where <strong>LAT_N</strong> is the northern latitude and <strong>LONG_W</strong> is the western longitude.

For example, if there are three records in the table with <strong>CITY</strong> values 'New York', 'New York', 'Bengalaru', there are 2 different city names: 'New York' and 'Bengalaru'. The query returns $1$, because $\text{total number of records}-\text{number of unique city names}=3-2=1$.
