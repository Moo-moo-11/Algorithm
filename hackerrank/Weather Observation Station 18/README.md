# [Weather Observation Station 18](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-18/problem)

Consider $P_{1}(a,b)$ and $P_{2}(c,d)$ to be two points on a 2D plane.

$a$ happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in <strong>STATION</strong>).

$b$ happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in <strong>STATION</strong>).

$c$ happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in <strong>STATION</strong>).

$d$ happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in <strong>STATION</strong>).

Query the [Manhattan Distance](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html) between points $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ and round it to a scale of $4$ decimal places.

<strong>Input Format</strong>

The <strong>STATION</strong> table is described as follows:

![Picture](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg)

where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.
